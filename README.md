# ConnectFour
A game of classic Connect4 but the human plays a Bot! The game has been coded in Java and has been implemented using OOP concepts and design. The Bot is not intelligent and plays randomly, so you should be able to beat him! Give it a try...

This project was completed as part of my MSc at The University of Bath and I was awarded a grade of 80%
